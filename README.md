This is a complete project developed for the Software Village Course. While writing this project, I used ASP.NET 8 and MVC technology. 
The project is connected to a MS SQL SERVER database. I have added an email messaging feature to the project. 
Whenever an application is made, an email message is sent to the course owner, allowing them to quickly get in touch with the user.
